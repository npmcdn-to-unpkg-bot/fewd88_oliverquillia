Project Proposal: Personal Website

Would like to create a 'portfolio/about me' website, highlighting some work and maintain a blog. 

I like the way the essay site Medium looks, works and feels, but I would like to add my own design perspective to it, if possible.

Currently, I redirect my site to a tumblr page, mostly because I like their easy to use CMS, and the wide variety of templates. It also allows a certain amount of code modifying.

The site should be responsive and possibly have the desktop version offer something maybe a phone couldn't deliver. I'm not too interested in parallax effects - unless I can find a somewhat original take on it, or for the sake of using Javascript.
